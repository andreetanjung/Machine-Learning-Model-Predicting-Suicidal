# Machine-Learning-Model-Predicting-Suicidal
### Supervised Learning with Best Model Predicting Suicidal Based on Depression and Anxiety
In this notebook we will attempt to predict whether the individuals on dataset would likely to commit suicide or not based on their anxiety and depression. The dataset is about individuals and their mental health, with information such as their demographic, depression, anxiety and stress scale and whether individuals are diagnosed with depression or anxiety by medical professional. The objective is to develop classification models that can accurately distinguish the target prediction with the highest possible score.
